//! Isolated FFI helper for RustConn's startup locale.
//!
//! `setlocale(3)` is the one part of the gettext API that cannot be wrapped
//! safely. It non-atomically replaces process-global locale state and reads the
//! environment without synchronisation, so it is only sound while the process
//! is still single-threaded — the unsoundness reported as
//! [RUSTSEC-2026-0244](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0244).
//! `gettext-rs` 0.8 marks it `unsafe` for exactly that reason, and no other crate
//! in this workspace may write `unsafe` at all. Hence this crate. The workspace
//! lint is `deny` rather than `forbid` so that the three `-sys` crates can
//! re-open it for themselves and still inherit the workspace's clippy set; see
//! the `[lints]` note in `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! It exposes one operation, [`init_locale`], and one way to close the window
//! in which that operation is allowed, [`seal_locale`]. The rest of the gettext
//! API — `bindtextdomain`, `bind_textdomain_codeset`, `textdomain`, `gettext`,
//! `ngettext` — is safe and is called directly from `rustconn`; deliberately
//! none of it is re-exported here, so this crate stays a wrapper around the one
//! call that needs a contract.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! [`init_locale`] may be called only:
//!
//! * from `main()`, before any thread is spawned — that means before a tokio
//!   runtime, before GTK/GIO, and before the tracing subscriber;
//! * from the same thread every time;
//! * before any POSIX signal handler is installed. This is the second half of
//!   the safety contract `gettext-rs` 0.8 states for `setlocale`: call it as
//!   early as possible, before starting more threads *or enabling any POSIX
//!   signals*. A handler that fires mid-call runs on the calling thread and can
//!   observe — or worse, act on — half-replaced locale state;
//! * before [`seal_locale`], which the caller invokes once the startup locale
//!   is final.
//!
//! A violation of a *checked* clause panics rather than silently corrupting
//! locale state. A panic here is a programming bug (M-PANIC-ON-BUG), not a
//! runtime condition: it means a `setlocale` call moved out of the startup
//! window, which no user input can cause.
//!
//! # What is checked, and what is not
//!
//! Not all four clauses are enforceable, so this section says exactly which are.
//!
//! Enforced on every platform:
//!
//! * **Thread identity** — a call from a thread other than the first caller is
//!   refused. This is the clause that still catches a regression off Linux: any
//!   caller that appears after startup necessarily runs on a GTK, GIO or tokio
//!   thread.
//! * **Sealing** — a call after [`seal_locale`] is refused.
//!
//! Enforced on Linux only:
//!
//! * **Thread count growth** — `/proc/self/task` is counted on the first
//!   admitted call to establish a *baseline*. Subsequent calls refuse if the
//!   count has grown beyond that baseline, which means RustConn's own code
//!   spawned a thread between calls. The baseline tolerates threads that
//!   already exist when `main()` starts — shared-library constructors
//!   (OpenSSL's DRBG jitter thread, p11-kit, GLib) legitimately create threads
//!   during ELF `.init_array` execution before `main()` is entered
//!   ([#271 comment](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/271#issuecomment-5258089991),
//!   observed on Fedora 44 with glibc 2.43 / OpenSSL 3.5).
//!   No other platform is asked, macOS included, even though RustConn ships
//!   macOS builds: obtaining the count there means
//!   `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDTASKINFO)` or `task_threads()`, which would add a
//!   second `unsafe` block and a hand-transcribed C struct layout to the crate
//!   whose entire purpose is to keep the unsafe surface small — and no CI job
//!   builds macOS, so neither would ever be compiled, let alone tested. The
//!   check is defence-in-depth; what makes the call sound is the call site, and
//!   the thread-identity clause above still guards a regression.
//!
//! Not enforced anywhere:
//!
//! * **No signal handlers.** There is no cheap check, and no honest one: the
//!   Rust runtime installs its own `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS` handler for
//!   stack-overflow detection and ignores `SIGPIPE` before `main()` is entered,
//!   so "no POSIX signals enabled" is already false in every Rust process. On
//!   Linux the `SigCgt` mask in `/proc/self/status` is therefore non-zero from
//!   the start and cannot distinguish the runtime's handlers from an
//!   application's; a check would refuse every call. RustConn satisfies this
//!   clause by ordering instead: `i18n::init()` is the first statement of
//!   `main()`, ahead of every handler the application or GTK installs.

// The one lint this crate re-opens out of the inherited workspace set, which is
// `deny` rather than `forbid` precisely so that this line is possible. `expect`
// rather than `allow`: if the `unsafe` call below ever goes away, the compiler
// says so instead of leaving a stale exemption behind — and a `-sys` crate with
// no `unsafe` left has no reason to exist and should be folded into its caller.

    unsafe_code,
    reason = "sanctioned FFI crate (M-UNSAFE); the guarded setlocale call is its entire purpose"

    //
    //  * the startup window is still open — `seal_locale` has not run;
    //  * this is the thread that made every earlier call;
    //  * on Linux, and only there, `/proc/self/task` reported a thread count
    //    that has not grown beyond the baseline established on the first call.
    //
    //    Threads that already existed at that first call are tolerated rather
    //    than refused, and this is the one clause that is a judgement rather
    //    than a proof. A shared library's ELF constructor can spawn a thread
    //    before `main()` is entered — observed on Fedora 44 (issue #271) — and
    //    such a thread is not reachable from here to inspect: whether it reads
    //    locale state is not something this crate can establish. What it can
    //    establish is that nothing *this program* started is running, which is
    //    the case the call site controls and the case a regression would
    //    create. Treating an unavoidable, pre-`main()` library thread as a
    //    hard error made the guard refuse a correct call site and abort at
    //    startup, which is a worse outcome than the residual risk: the two
    //    calls happen within a few statements of each other at the top of
    //    `main()`, so the window in which anything could observe half-replaced
    //    locale state is as small as the program can make it.
    //
    //    Elsewhere — macOS — that count is unavailable and the absence of a
    //    new thread is *not* verified here; it follows from the call site
    //    instead. Both callers (`rustconn::i18n::init` and
    //    `rustconn::i18n::apply_language_from_config`) run from `main()` before
    //    GTK, GIO, tokio or the tracing subscriber start, and any call that
    //    appeared later would come from one of those threads and be refused by
    //    the thread-identity check above.
    //
    // Upstream additionally asks that no POSIX signal handler be enabled yet.
    // That clause is not checked — it is not checkable, since the Rust runtime
    // installs its own handlers before `main()` (see the crate docs) — and is
    // likewise satisfied by ordering: nothing installs a handler before
    // `i18n::init()`, the first statement of `main()`.
    //
    // `locale` is copied into a NUL-terminated buffer by `gettextrs` before the
    // C call and the result is copied out of the returned pointer before this
    // returns, so no borrow outlives the call.
