//! Isolated FFI helpers for RustConn's PTY layer.
//!
//! This crate is one of the workspace's four sanctioned locations for `unsafe`
//! code (per the M-UNSAFE guideline), alongside `rustconn-locale-sys` for the
//! startup `setlocale` call, `rustconn-env-sys` for the startup environment
//! writes, and `rustconn-dock-sys` for the macOS Dock tile image. It was the
//! first, hence the wording it used to carry. It provides:
//!
//! - [`set_controlling_terminal`] — `pre_exec` hook for `setsid` + `TIOCSCTTY`
//! - [`open_pty_pair`] — creates a PTY master/slave pair via `openpty(2)`
//! - [`pty_set_winsize`] — sends `TIOCSWINSZ` to size the terminal
//! - [`pty_wait_readable`] — `poll(2)` with a timeout, so a reader thread can stop
//! - [`dup_fd`] — close-on-exec duplicate of a descriptor
//!
//! Reading and writing the descriptor itself is deliberately absent: the caller
//! turns the master into a [`std::fs::File`], so no session data passes through
//! any `unsafe` code.

// The one lint this crate re-opens out of the inherited workspace set, which is
// `deny` rather than `forbid` precisely so that this line is possible. `expect`
// rather than `allow`: if the `unsafe` blocks below ever go away, the compiler
// says so instead of leaving a stale exemption behind — and a `-sys` crate with
// no `unsafe` left has no reason to exist and should be folded into its caller.
