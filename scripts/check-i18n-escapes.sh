#!/usr/bin/env bash
# `env bash` rather than `/bin/bash`, matching every other script here: this one
# uses `mapfile`, a bash 4 builtin, and `/bin/bash` on macOS is 3.2.57. The
# mismatch was invisible for as long as nobody ran it through its own shebang —
# `bash scripts/check-i18n-escapes.sh` picks up whichever bash is on PATH and
# works, while `./scripts/check-i18n-escapes.sh` did not. `release.sh` runs it
# the second way, so the release gate failed on the maintainer's own platform
# with `mapfile: command not found`.
# Reject Rust-only string escapes inside translatable literals.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# po/update-pot.sh extracts strings with `xgettext --language=C`, because
# xgettext has no native Rust parser and the `gettext("...")` call syntax is
# identical to C. That works for the call syntax, but NOT for the string
# literal body: Rust and C do not share the same escape grammar.
#
# Rust writes a codepoint as `\u{2019}` (braces, variable width).
# C writes it as `\u2019` / `\U0001F600` (no braces, fixed width).
#
# So when xgettext sees a Rust literal like
#
#     i18n("Don\u{2019}t show this page at startup")
#
# it does not recognise `\u{...}` as an escape and copies those seven
# characters into the .pot verbatim. The resulting msgid is
#
#     Don\u{2019}t show this page at startup     <- what translators receive
#
# but at runtime rustc has already decoded the literal, so i18n() looks up
#
#     Don't show this page at startup            <- what gettext is asked for
#
# The two never match. The lookup silently falls through to the msgid itself,
# so the string renders untranslated in EVERY locale while the .po files look
# 100% complete. There is no compiler error, no gettext warning, and
# `msgfmt --check` passes — which is exactly why this needs a dedicated guard.
# It bit us once already (welcome-screen checkbox in split_view/bridge.rs).
#
# FIX WHEN THIS FIRES
# -------------------
# Put the character directly in the source literal instead of escaping it:
#
#     i18n("Don't show this page at startup")     # ASCII — project convention
#
# The codebase uses the ASCII apostrophe in translatable strings (see
# i18n("Don't Save") in rustconn/src/alert.rs), so prefer that for apostrophes.
# Then regenerate the template with po/update-pot.sh.
#
# NOT COVERED YET: the same Rust-vs-C mismatch, via line continuation
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# A translatable literal split across lines with a trailing backslash hits this
# from the other side. In C a backslash-newline splices the literal and KEEPS
# the indentation of the next line; rustc strips leading whitespace after it.
# So
#
#     i18n("A sentence that was too long \
#           to fit on one line")
#
# yields a msgid carrying ten spaces the program never asks for, and the lookup
# misses in exactly the silent way described above. Thirteen msgid in
# po/rustconn.pot still have this — find them with `grep -n '   ' po/rustconn.pot`
# (three consecutive spaces); rustconn/src/dialogs/flatpak_components.rs:158,
# rustconn/src/dialogs/variables.rs:170 and rustconn/src/app.rs:1176 are
# examples. Fixing them changes the msgid, so it touches all 17 catalogues and
# was deferred out of 0.20.9. A guard for it belongs in this script.
#
