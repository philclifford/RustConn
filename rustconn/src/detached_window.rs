//! Top-level windows that host a single detached session.
//!
//! A detached window is a pure **view host**: it borrows the widget subtree of a
//! session that [`crate::terminal::TerminalNotebook`] still owns. It stores no
//! session state beyond the two ids it needs for its own callbacks, so every
//! per-session map keeps working while the session lives outside the main
//! window.
//!
//! Replaces the never-constructed `ExternalWindow` / `ExternalWindowManager`
//! pair: that one reparented a bare `vte4::Terminal`, had no toast overlay, no
//! per-window accelerator wiring, and no way back into a tab.
//!
//! Callbacks installed here are plain boxed closures. The window layer wires
//! them with `Weak` handles to the notebook and the registry, so nothing in this
//! module can form an `Rc` cycle that outlives a session.
