//! Moves bytes between a session's PTY and the rest of the application.
//!
//! The relay owns the master descriptor produced by [`super::pty_spawn`] and
//! runs two threads around it:
//!
//! - a **reader** that blocks on the descriptor and publishes every chunk the
//!   child wrote on a channel, and
//! - a **writer** that drains a queue of input onto the descriptor.
//!
//! Both exist to keep the GTK main thread out of blocking I/O. The reader must
//! block, because output has to reach the terminal the moment it is produced;
//! the writer must block, because a PTY write stalls when the child is not
//! reading (a paste into a stopped process is enough) and doing that on the
//! main thread would freeze the window.
//!
//! Output is delivered as [`Zeroizing`] chunks, and input is queued the same
//! way: everything a session types passes through here, including the password
//! an expect rule answers a prompt with.
//!
//! Nothing in this module touches GTK, so it is tested against a real PTY pair
//! without a display. The GTK side of the wiring — feeding the terminal,
//! forwarding `commit`, and the window-size poll — lives in
//! [`super::TerminalNotebook`].
