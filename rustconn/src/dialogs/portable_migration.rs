//! Migration wizard for the portable encrypted file backend.
//!
//! Offers to bulk-transfer credentials from the machine-bound encrypted file
//! into the portable, passphrase-protected one (issue #293), so switching
//! backends does not leave every stored password behind.
//!
//! Only one direction is offered. Going back is not a wizard: the machine-bound
//! store is always readable on this machine, so "return these to the local file"
//! is the fallback chain's job, not a migration the user has to run.
//!
//! GNOME HIG: `AdwAlertDialog` for the decision, `AdwToast` for the outcome.
