//! Internationalization support via gettext
//!
//! This module initializes gettext for the RustConn GUI application
//! and provides convenience macros for translatable strings.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use crate::i18n::i18n;
//!
//! let msg = i18n("Connection failed");
//! let msg = i18n_f("Deleted '{}'", &[&name]);
//! let msg = ni18n("1 connection", "{} connections", count);
//! ```

pub const GETTEXT_DOMAIN: &str = "rustconn";

/// Initializes gettext for the application.
///
/// Must be called once at startup before any translatable strings are used.
/// Sets up the locale, text domain, and locale directory.
pub fn init() {
    // Set locale from environment.
    //
    // Routed through `rustconn-locale-sys` because `setlocale` is `unsafe` and
    // sound only while the process is single-threaded (RUSTSEC-2026-0244). That
    // crate checks the precondition and panics if it no longer holds, so the
    // requirement "call this first in `main()`" is enforced rather than assumed.
    //
    // The applied locale is dropped rather than reported, deliberately:
    //
    //  * there is nowhere to report it to. This runs as the first statement of
    //    `main()`, which is the whole point — the tracing subscriber is
    //    installed several statements later, so a `warn!` here is swallowed.
    //  * `None` is not an error state we can act on. It means the locale named
    //    by the environment is not installed, which is routine in a Flatpak
    //    sandbox (the runtime ships only the host language, issue #158). The
    //    previous locale stays in effect, gettext falls back to the untranslated
    //    strings, and the user sees English — visible without a log line.
    //  * where the outcome *is* actionable — a specific language configured by
    //    the user — it is checked: `apply_language_setlocale` below inspects the
    //    result and falls back to the system locale.

/// Reads the saved language from `config.toml` and applies it at startup.

/// A non-system language is applied in two steps, both of which are needed: the
/// `LANGUAGE` environment variable is set (gettext's primary lookup mechanism,
/// written through [`rustconn_env_sys`] because `std::env::set_var` is `unsafe`
/// in edition 2024), and then the locale is applied with `setlocale`, which is
/// what makes gettext re-read the variable. See [`apply_configured_language`]
/// for why neither half suffices alone.
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// This is the **only** place that applies a locale after [`init`], and it must
/// stay that way: `setlocale` mutates process-global locale state with no
/// synchronisation, so it is only sound while the process is still
/// single-threaded (RUSTSEC-2026-0244). The same is true of the environment
/// write. Both therefore happen here, called from `main()` before GTK, tokio or
/// the tracing subscriber exist. Applying either later — for example from the GTK
/// `activate` handler, where the GIO worker thread is already running — would
/// reintroduce the unsoundness.
///
/// On return the locale is sealed, so that "later" is a panic during development
/// rather than memory corruption in the field. The environment is sealed
/// separately, by [`crate::renderer::apply_renderer_preference`], which `main()`
/// calls after this — the renderer choice is the other startup variable and has
/// to be written before it can close the window for both.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the environment write is refused, which means this ran outside the
/// startup window: after a thread was spawned, from a thread other than the one
/// `main()` runs on, or after the environment was sealed. All three are
/// programming errors in `main()`'s ordering, not runtime conditions.
