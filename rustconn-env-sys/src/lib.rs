//! Isolated FFI helper for the one environment variable RustConn sets at startup.
//!
//! `std::env::set_var` is `unsafe` in the 2024 edition because it is a wrapper
//! around `setenv(3)`, which mutates the process-global environment block
//! without synchronisation. A concurrent `getenv` — from any thread, including
//! one inside a C library RustConn links — can read a half-updated block, or
//! keep using a string `setenv` has already freed. Every other crate in this
//! workspace denies `unsafe_code`, so the call lives here, behind a guard that
//! refuses it outside the window in which it is sound. `deny` rather than
//! `forbid` is what lets this crate re-open the lint for itself while still
//! inheriting the workspace's clippy set; see the `[lints]` note in `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! It exposes one operation, [`set_startup_var`], and one way to close the
//! window in which that operation is allowed, [`seal_env`]. Reading the
//! environment is safe and is done directly from the other crates with
//! `std::env::var`; deliberately nothing of that is re-exported here, so this
//! crate stays a wrapper around the one call that needs a contract.
//!
//! # Why RustConn needs to write the environment at all
//!
//! Two startup settings are exposed by their host library as an environment
//! variable and nothing else — no API exists to pass either one:
//!
//! * **`GSK_RENDERER`**, GTK's only interface for choosing a GSK renderer, read
//!   while the first surface is realised and therefore needed before `gtk_init`.
//!   RustConn selects the Cairo renderer in the two situations where the GPU path
//!   is known to be worse than software rasterisation: X11 compositors that paint
//!   popovers blank until hovered
//!   ([#85](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/85)), and macOS guests
//!   on Apple Silicon, whose paravirtualised GPU offers Metal but no accelerated
//!   OpenGL, leaving GSK's GL renderer on a software fallback
//!   ([#274](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/274)).
//! * **`LANGUAGE`**, GNU gettext's primary catalogue-selection mechanism, needed
//!   before the first translatable string is evaluated. It matters beyond
//!   `setlocale` because gettext honours it even when the named locale is not
//!   installed, which is the normal case inside a Flatpak sandbox
//!   ([#158](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/158)).
//!
//! Both used to be applied by re-execing the process with the variable set in the
//! child, which sidesteps `set_var` entirely. That works on Linux but is
//! unavailable on macOS: replacing the process image destroys the LaunchServices
//! scene registration `NSStatusItem` needs, and the tray icon silently
//! disappears. Setting the variables in-process is what lets both platforms share
//! one code path, at the cost of the guarded `unsafe` below — and it removes two
//! process spawns from startup.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! [`set_startup_var`] may be called only:
//!
//! * from `main()`, before any thread is spawned — that means before a tokio
//!   runtime, before GTK/GIO, and before the tracing subscriber;
//! * from the same thread every time;
//! * before [`seal_env`], which the caller invokes once the startup environment
//!   is final.
//!
//! A violation of a *checked* clause panics rather than silently corrupting the
//! environment block. A panic here is a programming bug (M-PANIC-ON-BUG), not a
//! runtime condition: it means an environment write moved out of the startup
//! window, which no user input can cause.
//!
//! # What is checked, and what is not
//!
//! Enforced on every platform:
//!
//! * **Thread identity** — a call from a thread other than the first caller is
//!   refused. This is the clause that still catches a regression off Linux: any
//!   caller that appears after startup necessarily runs on a GTK, GIO or tokio
//!   thread.
//! * **Sealing** — a call after [`seal_env`] is refused.
//!
//! Enforced on Linux only:
//!
//! * **Thread count growth** — `/proc/self/task` is counted on the first
//!   admitted call to establish a *baseline*; a later call refuses if the count
//!   has grown past it, which means RustConn's own code spawned a thread in
//!   between. The baseline tolerates threads that already exist when `main()`
//!   starts, because shared-library constructors legitimately create them during
//!   ELF `.init_array` execution before `main()` is entered (observed on Fedora
//!   44 with glibc 2.43 / OpenSSL 3.5, issue #271). No other platform is asked,
//!   macOS included: obtaining the count there means
//!   `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDTASKINFO)` or `task_threads()`, which would add
//!   `libc` and a hand-transcribed C struct layout to the crate whose entire
//!   purpose is to keep the unsafe surface small — and no CI job builds macOS,
//!   so neither would ever be compiled, let alone tested. The check is
//!   defence-in-depth; what makes the call sound is the call site, and the
//!   thread-identity clause above still guards a regression.
//!
//! This mirrors [`rustconn-locale-sys`], which guards `setlocale(3)` under the
//! same conditions. The guard is deliberately duplicated rather than shared: a
//! common crate would make each `-sys` crate depend on something other than
//! `std`, and the whole point of both is to be small enough to audit in one
//! sitting. Any change to the reasoning above belongs in both.
//!
//! [`rustconn-locale-sys`]: https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/tree/main/rustconn-locale-sys

// The one lint this crate re-opens out of the inherited workspace set, which is
// `deny` rather than `forbid` precisely so that this line is possible. `expect`
// rather than `allow`: if the `unsafe` call below ever goes away, the compiler
// says so instead of leaving a stale exemption behind — and a `-sys` crate with
// no `unsafe` left has no reason to exist and should be folded into its caller.
