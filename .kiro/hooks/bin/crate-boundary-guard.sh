# PreToolUse guard: block writes that violate the two hardest-to-reverse
# architectural invariants.
#
#   1. rustconn-core / rustconn-cli are GUI-free — no gtk4 / adw / vte4.
#   2. `unsafe` lives only in the sanctioned rustconn-*-sys crates
#      (unsafe_code = "deny" workspace-wide, Cargo.toml, re-opened by a
#      crate-level #![expect(unsafe_code, …)] in each of those crates).
#
# Reads the PreToolUse JSON on stdin, exits 2 with an explanation on stderr to
# block, exits 0 silently otherwise.
#
# Why a command hook and not an agent prompt: an agent action cannot decide, so
# every write was cancelled, acknowledged and re-issued — two round trips per
# edit, on every edit. This does the same two greps for free.
#
# Fails OPEN. A guard that blocks every write because jq changed its output
# format would be far worse than one that occasionally misses a violation, and
# both invariants are also hard compile errors, so the build is the real net.

# --- Invariant 2: unsafe only in the sanctioned FFI crates ------------------

# small, separately reviewable FFI crate, not that there is exactly one of
# them. There are three today (rustconn-pty-sys, rustconn-locale-sys,
# rustconn-env-sys). Each re-opens the lint with a crate-level
# #![expect(unsafe_code, reason = "…")] in its own src/lib.rs, so adding one is a
# visible, reviewed act.
#
# `extern` is in the keyword list for edition-2024 `unsafe extern "C" { … }` and
# `unsafe extern "C" fn`. The compiler's `unsafe_code = "deny"` already rejects
# both, so this is defence-in-depth. The `*/rustconn-*-sys/*` arm is a
# belt-and-braces exemption for the case where the normalisation above could not
# find a repo root: better to miss a violation than to block a legitimate edit to
# an FFI crate, per the fail-open contract.
