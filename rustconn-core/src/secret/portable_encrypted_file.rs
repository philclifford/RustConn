//! Portable encrypted-file secret backend (passphrase-based, cloud-syncable).
//!
//! A variant of [`super::encrypted_file::EncryptedFileBackend`] whose encryption
//! key comes from a **user-supplied passphrase** instead of a machine-specific
//! key, so the file can live in any cloud-synced directory and be opened on any
//! machine — including across Linux and macOS (issue #293).
//!
//! ## Key hierarchy
//!
//! The store uses a key-encryption-key / data-encryption-key split rather than
//! deriving a key per entry:
//!
//! ```text
//! passphrase ──Argon2id(kdf_salt, kdf_params)──▶ KEK
//!                                                 │
//!                          wrapped_key ──open──▶ DEK ──▶ every entry
//! ```
//!
//! One Argon2id derivation unlocks the whole file; each entry then costs a
//! single AES-256-GCM pass. Deriving per entry instead would make one
//! `retrieve` cost a full KDF (~0.5 s) and a 50-entry migration cost fifty of
//! them. The split also buys two properties the per-entry scheme cannot offer:
//! the passphrase can be verified by unwrapping the key (no need to guess which
//! entry to trial-decrypt), and changing the passphrase rewraps 32 bytes rather
//! than re-encrypting every credential.
//!
//! ## File format
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "format_version": 1,
//!   "kdf": "argon2id",
//!   "kdf_params": { "m_cost": 65536, "t_cost": 3, "p_cost": 4 },
//!   "kdf_salt": "<base64, 16 bytes>",
//!   "wrapped_key": "<base64: nonce(12) + DEK ciphertext(32) + tag(16)>",
//!   "entries": {
//!     "rustconn/my-server": "<base64: nonce(12) + ciphertext + tag(16)>"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `kdf_params` are per-file, so raising the defaults leaves existing files
//! openable: a store keeps the cost it was created with until it is rewritten.
//! Entry blobs and the wrapped key are bound to their role by AAD
//! ([`AAD_ENTRY`] / [`AAD_WRAPPED_KEY`]), so moving one into the other's slot
//! fails authentication instead of silently decrypting.
//!
//! ## Unlock model
//!
//! The backend starts **locked** (no passphrase). Any `store`/`retrieve`/
//! `delete` while locked returns [`SecretError::PassphraseRequired`]; the GUI
//! intercepts it, prompts, and calls
//! [`PortableEncryptedFileBackend::set_passphrase`]. A wrong passphrase is
//! reported as [`SecretError::IncorrectPassphrase`] so the caller can tell "ask
//! again" from "this file is broken".
//!
//! ## Cloud-sync ceiling
//!
//! Every write is a read-modify-write of the whole JSON file, so two machines
//! that both write while offline resolve as last-writer-wins and one set of
//! additions is lost. The DEK cache is keyed on `kdf_salt` *and* `wrapped_key`
//! so a file replaced by the sync client — or rewrapped under the same salt — is
//! noticed rather than decrypted with a stale key, but concurrent edits from
//! different machines are not merged.
//!
//! Within one process the interleaving is closed: `store` and `delete` hold a
//! mutex across the whole read-modify-write, so two overlapping writes queue
//! instead of losing an entry. Nothing analogous exists *between* processes —
//! two RustConn instances on the same synced folder, or a second machine — and
//! an advisory `flock` would not help across the network and FUSE mounts this
//! backend targets.
//!
//! ponytail: whole-file rewrite per entry, fine for the single-writer-at-a-time
//! use this targets; split the map into one file per entry if concurrent writes
//! from several machines become a real workflow, so the sync client merges them.
//!
//! ## Secret hygiene
//!
//! The passphrase is held in a `SecretString`; the DEK lives in
//! `Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>`; all intermediate plaintext is `Zeroizing`.
//! [`StoredCredentials`] (shared with [`super::encrypted_file`]) wipes on drop
//! and redacts in `Debug`.

/// The key hierarchy makes a cheaper implementation available: reseal the same

/// bytes. This does not do that. Someone changes a passphrase because the old one
/// may be known — written down, shared, typed into the wrong window — and anyone
/// who knew it could have unwrapped the DEK and kept it. Rewrapping leaves that
/// DEK in force, so every credential saved *after* the change stays readable to
/// them, and the change would have achieved nothing it was done for.
///
/// So a fresh DEK is generated and every entry is re-encrypted under it. The cost
/// is one AES-GCM pass per entry — microseconds each, against the ~0.5 s Argon2id
/// derivation that dominates either way. What the KEK/DEK split still buys is
/// that this pays *one* derivation rather than one per entry.
///
/// The new store is written at the stronger of the old file's key-derivation cost
/// and the current default, per parameter, so a store created by an earlier
/// release picks up a cost increase — and one deliberately hardened past the
/// default is not quietly weakened back down to it. [`check_kdf_cost`] admits up
/// to four times the defaults, so such a file legitimately exists.
///
/// # What a passphrase change does not do
///
/// It protects credentials saved from now on. Anyone holding the old passphrase
/// *and* a copy of the old file still reads every credential that was in it at
/// the moment of the change — no rotation of this file can reach a copy that has
/// already left. Changing the passphrase is therefore not a substitute for
/// changing the passwords it protected, and "re-encrypted 12 entries" should not
/// be read as "those 12 are now safe".
///
/// [`check_kdf_cost`]: PortableStoreFile::check_kdf_cost
///
/// # Failure behaviour
///
/// All or nothing. A single unreadable entry aborts the change and leaves the
/// file untouched under its old passphrase, rather than writing a store that
/// opens with the new one and is missing credentials. The alternative — skip what
/// cannot be read and report it — trades a recoverable failure for silent
/// permanent loss, since the entry's old ciphertext would be gone.
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// This is a read-modify-write of the whole file and it does **not** hold
