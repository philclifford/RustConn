//! Waiting for a child process with a deadline.
//!
//! `std::process::Child` offers `wait`/`wait_with_output`, which block until the
//! child decides to exit, and `try_wait`, which never blocks and never finishes.
//! Bounding a child therefore means polling `try_wait` against a deadline and
//! killing it when the deadline passes — about fifteen lines, which is why four
//! copies of them had accumulated: [`crate::which`]'s host probe,
//! [`crate::connection::mdns`]'s name resolution and `protocol::detection`'s
//! version check each grew their own, and `secret::status` had none at all and
//! blocked indefinitely on `keepassxc-cli` at a dozen call sites.
//!
//! The copies differed in what they did on expiry — one returned `None`, one
//! returned a placeholder string — which is a caller's decision and is why
//! [`wait_bounded`] reports [`Waited::TimedOut`] instead of choosing. What none
//! of them differed in, and what a fifth copy would have got wrong eventually,
//! is that a killed child still has to be reaped or it becomes a zombie for the
//! lifetime of the process.
//!
//! For an async caller this module is the wrong tool: `tokio::process::Child`
//! composes with `tokio::time::timeout` directly, and `secret::bitwarden` and
//! `secret::script_resolver` already do that.
